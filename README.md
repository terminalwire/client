# Terminalwire Client

This repo packages up the `terminalwire-exec` executable from the `terminalwire` Ruby Gem into a self-contained binary that can run on workstations that don't have Ruby installed.

It's primarly a collection of shell & Ruby scripts that glue together the `ruby-install` scripts, and other installation scripts, to create a self-contained binary.
